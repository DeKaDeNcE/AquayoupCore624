FelwoodCore 6.2.4 - Based on AquayoupCore/TrinityCore - is a MMORPG Source based on mostly C++.

FelwoodCore624 (based on AquayoupCore) has a wide variety of custom Mods built into the Core such as:
+ SoloCraft (Dungeons, Raids, World Bosses getting Downscaled to your Groupsize
this makes it possible to make Raids and Dungeons with 1+ Person(s).
+ All Classes All Races (ARAC)
+ NPC to change Race, Faction, Gender etc. (.npc add 15000142)
+ NPC Bots inside Citys to make the Server feel more "alive".
+ A ton of custom Class Reworks and changes. (Non Blizzlike)

## Focus of FelwoodCore 6.2.4
The focus of FelwoodCore is currently on the "old" content in the range of 1-90, whereby most of the content has been fixed to 85-90 (by the Aquayoup Team!). 1-85 is almost completely Stock Trinity with some minor exceptions especially in the classes. The focus after the "work up" of 1-90 (85-90) is of course on the content of Warlords of Draenor 90-100 & Endgame. Draenor is completely spawned but without any scripted content!

## Download Database
The Database for the FelwoodCore-WOD can be found in the "release" Section of this Source.

## Is the Project completely Open Source?
